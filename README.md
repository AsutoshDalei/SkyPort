# SkyPort — Single-Player Flying Sandbox

A minimal 3D flying sandbox where you control a plane and soar over a low-poly landscape with cities, villages, mountains, airports, and airstrips.

Built with **React**, **Three.js**, **React Three Fiber**, and **Vite**, containerized with **Docker**.

## Quick Start

```bash
# With Docker (recommended)
docker compose up --build
# → http://localhost:5173

# Without Docker
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Controls

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `W` | Throttle up |
| `S` | Throttle down / brake (on ground) |
| `↑` `↓` | Pitch up / down |
| `←` `→` | Roll (induces yaw turn) |

## What's Inside

### Flight
- Arcade-style flight physics with gravity, lift, and stall
- Speed-based lift: full lift at 80 kts, sinks below that
- Stall below 30 kts — plane descends under gravity
- Landing: touch down on any flat surface, brake to stop
- Ground friction, air drag, smooth pitch/roll interpolation

### World
- **Perlin noise heightmap** — rolling hills, vertex-colored by altitude (grass → dirt → rock → snow)
- **Boundary mountains** — ring of mountains closes off the airspace at map edges
- **City** — 9×9 block grid with skyscrapers, office buildings, window strips, antennas, AC units
- **5 Villages** — scattered homes with pitched roofs, doors, windows
- **Airport** — full runway with threshold markings, taxiway, terminal, 2 hangars, control tower, edge/approach lights
- **Airstrip** — grass/paved strip near a village with shed, windsock, edge markers
- 400 trees (pine, oak, bush), roads with center lines, lake, sky dome, animated clouds, fog

### HUD
- Compact bottom bar: status indicator, speed, throttle, altitude, heading, mini attitude indicator
- SpaceX-inspired dark monospace telemetry styling

### Plane Model
- Procedural low-poly mesh: cylindrical fuselage, tapered nose cone, cockpit windshield
- Swept wings with nav lights (red port / green starboard)
- Turbofan engine pods with intake rings
- Landing gear (nose + mains), rudder accent, tail strobe, underwing flaps
